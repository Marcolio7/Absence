    <h1>Absence reduction</h1>
    <p>Absence is a very important and central theme in this world. <br> It is important to take absence seriously and
    always <br> work to find out the reasons behind the high absence percentage <br> and to find different ways on how to lower the percentage.

    <p>If we take example in the US we can see that <br> over 8 million(!) students nearly misses a month of school yearly.
        <br> Research shows that missing 18 days of school a year or <br> 2 days a month negatively affects the students performance at school.
        <br> By the 6th grade and upwards chronic absence is starting to become the <br> central indicator to why students drop out.
        <br> Chronic absence is known as missing out 10% of the school or 2 days a month.</p>
