    <h1>How can we lower the absence?</h1>
    <h2>Problem; <br>How can attendance and registration data prevent people from dropping out of school? <br>
        How can technology play a role in solving this problem?</h2>
    <p>What we think is a good idea to lower the absence with help of registration data and technology <br>
        is to register the attendance of a class for a longer period. For example for a month. <br>
        If we take a small village with bad coverage and poor technical capabilities as a starting point, <br>
        weâ€™ll say you will have to register the attendance by pen and paper.The leader/teacher of the class register the attendance <br>
        and store it on the school for the month. After the period of time the school will transfer the registration data <br>
        to a place with better technical options and coverage and load it into a database which is able to process a large amount of data <br>
        efficiently and securely. Then the school will get the data for the attendance in that specific period.<br><br>

        After the school has looked opp all of the data and may see which students are most home from school <br>
        we think the solution will be to have an educator (if the attendance is very bad) to sit down and talk to the students concerned.<br>
        The educator should find out why the students are away from school and sort out a plan for the future <br>
        such as kind of a special treatment and a special program to motivate them for school and get the students on the right path.
